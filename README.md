Description: Build a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to forecast future trends. This could be predicting stock prices, sales, or any other time series data. Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib. Features: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, evaluation metrics, visualization of results. Example: "Stock Price Prediction using LSTM Networks" process// Load the Data: Use Python libraries like Pandas to load your data into a DataFrame. Handle Missing Values: Use techniques like interpolation, forward fill, or backward fill to handle missing values. Feature Engineering: Create additional features such as moving averages, lagged values, and date-time features (e.g., day of the week, month). Normalize/Scale Data: Normalize or scale the data to ensure the model performs well.
